Purpose:
  This is documentation for the data folder only.
It answers:
  What data belongs here?
  Where does it come from?
  What is included / excluded?
  What are licensing or privacy constraints?
  Why data may be missing from the repo
This is critical because:
  Data is often large, restricted, or external
  You may not commit raw data to GitHub
  Reproducibility depends on data clarity
