# Forecast Evaluation Metrics (Grid-Aware Interpretation)

## RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
RMSE penalizes large forecast errors more heavily than small ones.
In grid operations, large misses are disproportionately costly because they can:
- trigger reserve activation
- cause frequency deviations in weak grids
- increase ramping stress and operator intervention

RMSE is interpreted here as a proxy for **reserve stress risk**.

## MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
MAE reports average absolute deviation between forecast and actual.
Operationally, MAE represents typical “exposure” to forecast error:
- how much balancing is usually needed
- how often operators face moderate deviations

MAE is interpreted as **average operator exposure**.

## MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
MAPE can be misleading for solar because irradiance approaches zero at night and is
low during dawn/dusk. Percentage errors explode when the denominator is small.
For this reason, MAPE is computed only for hours above a low-irradiance threshold
(e.g., GHI > 50 Wh/m²).

MAPE is included cautiously and never treated as the primary metric.

Metrics are interpreted in the context of **operational risk**, not leaderboard performance.
